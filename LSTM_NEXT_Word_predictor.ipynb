While most kids in his village spent their time playing games, Aryan preferred to ask questions — about stars, trees, and everything in between.\n","\n","He lived in a small cottage at the edge of the village, just where the forest began. His grandmother often told him stories of magical lands hidden deep within those woods.\n","\n","One morning, as the sun peeked through the misty trees, Aryan packed a bag with bread, a bottle of water, and his old compass. Today, he was going to explore beyond the known trails.\n","\n","The forest greeted him with birdsong and golden light filtering through the branches. Each step he took felt like an invitation to something greater.\n","\n","He walked past the familiar oak tree, the one shaped like a question mark, and turned into a narrow path he had never noticed before.\n","\n","Leaves rustled under his feet, and a cool breeze brushed his face. It smelled of pine, earth, and mystery.\n","\n","As he walked deeper, the forest grew quieter. The usual chirping of birds faded, replaced by a distant humming sound, almost like music.\n","\n","He followed the sound, curious and excited. The path opened into a small clearing, where a waterfall spilled into a crystal-clear pond.\n","\n","Near the pond sat an old man with a long white beard, humming softly to himself and carving something into a piece of wood.\n","\n","Aryan stepped forward hesitantly. The old man looked up and smiled. “You’ve found the first gate,” he said, as if expecting him.\n","\n","Confused but intrigued, Aryan asked, “What gate? What is this place?”\n","\n","The man chuckled. “This is the edge of the Hidden Valley. Only those who truly seek can find it. But each gate asks for a gift.”\n","\n","Aryan thought for a moment and reached into his bag. He pulled out his compass and offered it. “This has guided me here.”\n","\n","The man accepted the compass with both hands and placed it inside a wooden box. The trees around them suddenly shimmered.\n","\n","A path revealed itself beyond the clearing, glowing faintly. “Follow it,” the old man said, “but remember — not everything is what it seems.”\n","\n","Aryan stepped onto the glowing trail. The air felt thicker, filled with energy. He could hear faint whispers as if the forest were alive.\n","\n","The path led to a stone archway, half-buried in vines. Strange symbols were carved into its surface, pulsing with soft blue light.\n","\n","As he approached the arch, the symbols rearranged themselves, forming a riddle: “I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. What am I?”\n","\n","Aryan paused, thinking hard. Then he whispered, “An echo.” The symbols flared brightly, and the arch opened into a spiraling tunnel of light.\n","\n","With a deep breath, Aryan stepped into the tunnel. Colors swirled around him, and the ground beneath him vanished. His journey had truly begun.\n","\n","The tunnel felt endless, yet Aryan wasn't afraid. Strange voices echoed around him — not loud, not scary, but soft and curious.\n","\n","Suddenly, the light faded, and Aryan found himself standing in a vast hall filled with mirrors. Each mirror reflected a different version of him.\n","\n","One showed him older and stronger, another smaller and afraid. A third mirror showed him surrounded by stars, holding a book with a glowing symbol.\n","\n","He reached out to touch the starry mirror, and it rippled like water. Without thinking, Aryan stepped through.\n","\n","On the other side, he stood on a platform floating in the sky. Strange flying creatures soared above, and silver bridges connected floating islands.\n","\n","A small mechanical bird flew to him and landed on his shoulder. “Keyholder Aryan, your presence is logged,” it chirped.\n","\n","“Keyholder?” Aryan whispered. He had never heard that term before.\n","\n","The bird’s eyes glowed blue. “Only the brave who pass the first gate can unlock the truth of the valley.”\n","\n","The bird flapped its wings and pointed toward a silver bridge. “Follow the path. The guardian awaits your question.”\n","\n","Aryan crossed the bridge, each step echoing in the sky. Beneath him, clouds swirled like living creatures.\n","\n","At the end of the bridge stood a tall figure wrapped in a cloak made of feathers and stars.\n","\n","“You seek the Valley’s secret,” the figure said without moving. “But first, answer me this: Why do you walk alone?”\n","\n","Aryan took a deep breath. “Because no one else believed. I had to believe for myself.”\n","\n","The guardian nodded slowly. “Then the second gate shall open.” A golden feather floated from his cloak.\n","\n","As Aryan caught the feather, the platform cracked, and everything around him began to dissolve into light.\n","\n","He felt no fear. Instead, he felt lighter — like he was becoming part of something larger.\n","\n","The light faded again, and Aryan landed gently in a circular garden glowing with blue and gold flowers.\n","\n","In the center of the garden stood a tree made of crystal. Hanging from its branches were dozens of keys, each glowing in a different color.\n","\n","A voice echoed from the sky: “Choose wisely. Only one key opens the door you truly seek.”\n","\n","Aryan looked at the keys carefully. Then, guided by instinct, he reached for the smallest one — dull silver with a faint hum.\n","'''\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install tensorflow\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from

boy. While most kids in his village spent their time playing games, Aryan preferred to ask questions — about stars, trees, and everything in between.\n","\n","He lived in a small cottage at the edge of the village, just where the forest began. His grandmother often told him stories of magical lands hidden deep within those woods.\n","\n","One morning, as the sun peeked through the misty trees, Aryan packed a bag with bread, a bottle of water, and his old compass. Today, he was going to explore beyond the known trails.\n","\n","The forest greeted him with birdsong and golden light filtering through the branches. Each step he took felt like an invitation to something greater.\n","\n","He walked past the familiar oak tree, the one shaped like a question mark, and turned into a narrow path he had never noticed before.\n","\n","Leaves rustled under his feet, and a cool breeze brushed his face. It smelled of pine, earth, and mystery.\n","\n","As he walked deeper, the forest grew quieter. The usual chirping of birds faded, replaced by a distant humming sound, almost like music.\n","\n","He followed the sound, curious and excited. The path opened into a small clearing, where a waterfall spilled into a crystal-clear pond.\n","\n","Near the pond sat an old man with a long white beard, humming softly to himself and carving something into a piece of wood.\n","\n","Aryan stepped forward hesitantly. The old man looked up and smiled. “You’ve found the first gate,” he said, as if expecting him.\n","\n","Confused but intrigued, Aryan asked, “What gate? What is this place?”\n","\n","The man chuckled. “This is the edge of the Hidden Valley. Only those who truly seek can find it. But each gate asks for a gift.”\n","\n","Aryan thought for a moment and reached into his bag. He pulled out his compass and offered it. “This has guided me here.”\n","\n","The man accepted the compass with both hands and placed it inside a wooden box. The trees around them suddenly shimmered.\n","\n","A path revealed itself beyond the clearing, glowing faintly. “Follow it,” the old man said, “but remember — not everything is what it seems.”\n","\n","Aryan stepped onto the glowing trail. The air felt thicker, filled with energy. He could hear faint whispers as if the forest were alive.\n","\n","The path led to a stone archway, half-buried in vines. Strange symbols were carved into its surface, pulsing with soft blue light.\n","\n","As he approached the arch, the symbols rearranged themselves, forming a riddle: “I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. What am I?”\n","\n","Aryan paused, thinking hard. Then he whispered, “An echo.” The symbols flared brightly, and the arch opened into a spiraling tunnel of light.\n","\n","With a deep breath, Aryan stepped into the tunnel. Colors swirled around him, and the ground beneath him vanished. His journey had truly begun.\n","\n","The tunnel felt endless, yet Aryan wasn't afraid. Strange voices echoed around him — not loud, not scary, but soft and curious.\n","\n","Suddenly, the light faded, and Aryan found himself standing in a vast hall filled with mirrors. Each mirror reflected a different version of him.\n","\n","One showed him older and stronger, another smaller and afraid. A third mirror showed him surrounded by stars, holding a book with a glowing symbol.\n","\n","He reached out to touch the starry mirror, and it rippled like water. Without thinking, Aryan stepped through.\n","\n","On the other side, he stood on a platform floating in the sky. Strange flying creatures soared above, and silver bridges connected floating islands.\n","\n","A small mechanical bird flew to him and landed on his shoulder. “Keyholder Aryan, your presence is logged,” it chirped.\n","\n","“Keyholder?” Aryan whispered. He had never heard that term before.\n","\n","The bird’s eyes glowed blue. “Only the brave who pass the first gate can unlock the truth of the valley.”\n","\n","The bird flapped its wings and pointed toward a silver bridge. “Follow the path. The guardian awaits your question.”\n","\n","Aryan crossed the bridge, each step echoing in the sky. Beneath him, clouds swirled like living creatures.\n","\n","At the end of the bridge stood a tall figure wrapped in a cloak made of feathers and stars.\n","\n","“You seek the Valley’s secret,” the figure said without moving. “But first, answer me this: Why do you walk alone?”\n","\n","Aryan took a deep breath. “Because no one else believed. I had to believe for myself.”\n","\n","The guardian nodded slowly. “Then the second gate shall open.” A golden feather floated from his cloak.\n","\n","As Aryan caught the feather, the platform cracked, and everything around him began to dissolve into light.\n","\n","He felt no fear. Instead, he felt lighter — like he was becoming part of something larger.\n","\n","The light faded again, and Aryan landed gently in a circular garden glowing with blue and gold flowers.\n","\n","In the center of the garden stood a tree made of crystal. Hanging from its branches were dozens of keys, each glowing in a different color.\n","\n","A voice echoed from the sky: “Choose wisely. Only one key opens the door you truly seek.”\n","\n","Aryan looked at the keys carefully. Then, guided by instinct, he reached for the smallest one — dull silver with a faint hum.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["input_sequences = []\n","target_words = []\n","\n","for sentence in story_text.split('\\n'):\n","    sentence = sentence.strip()\n","    if sentence:\n","        tokens = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([sentence])[0]\n","        for i in range(1, len(tokens)):\n","            input_seq = tokens[:i]\n","            target_seq = tokens[i]\n","            input_sequences.append(input_seq)\n","            target_words.append(target_seq)"],"metadata":{"id":"1iAGKG2LzR8Z","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754208889587,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Parv Gaur","userId":"10771597158067967299"}}},"execution_count":57,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["max_len_input = max([len(seq) for seq in input_sequences])\n"],"metadata":{"id":"l_asG-tSzx9s","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754208889642,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":54,"user":{"displayName":"Parv Gaur","userId":"10771597158067967299"}}},"execution_count":58,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(\"Max input length:\", max_len_input)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"eZrMv5bd4Xds","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754208889643,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":32,"user":{"displayName":"Parv Gaur","userId":"10771597158067967299"}},"outputId":"ab5771d2-ffb9-464a-aead-d8bf0be5e550"},"execution_count":59,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Max input length: 33\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences\n","X=pad_sequences(input_sequences, maxlen=max_len_input, padding='pre')\n"],"metadata":{"id":"I8LcPiXd5Fvq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754208889643,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":25,"user":{"displayName":"Parv Gaur","userId":"10771597158067967299"}}},"execution_count":60,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["X"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"DO5L9ShZ5fan","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754208889644,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":24,"user":{"displayName":"Parv Gaur","userId":"10771597158067967299"}},"outputId":"799f51ba-b27e-4b8e-9ec1-16170a0296d3"},"execution_count":61,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([[  0,   0,   0, ...,   0,   0,   4],\n","       [  0,   0,   0, ...,   0,   4,  34],\n","       [  0,   0,   0, ...,   4,  34,  35],\n","       ...,\n","       [  0,   0,   0, ..., 412,  65,  10],\n","       [  0,   0,   0, ...,  65,  10,   2],\n","       [  0,   0,   0, ...,  10,   2, 112]], dtype=int32)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":61}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical\n","total_words = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1\n","y = to_categorical(target_words, num_classes=total_words)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"vpJkZJiD5kGl","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754208889644,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":14,"user":{"displayName":"Parv Gaur","userId":"10771597158067967299"}}},"execution_count":62,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["X.shape,y.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"WHRXDjqf6meI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754208889644,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Parv Gaur","userId":"10771597158067967299"}},"outputId":"f109d6e8-c056-452a-c061-19ffc273349d"},"execution_count":63,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["((843, 33), (843, 414))"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":63}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Embedding, LSTM, Dense"],"metadata":{"id":"2gTDVCl77rSn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754208889645,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Parv Gaur","userId":"10771597158067967299"}}},"execution_count":64,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["model=Sequential()\n","model.add(Embedding(total_words, 100, input_length=max_len_input))\n","model.add(LSTM(150))\n","model.add(Dense(total_words, activation='softmax'))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"gfRI6ZA48SCp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1754208889664,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":24,"user":{"displayName":"Parv Gaur","userId":"10771597158067967299"}},"outputId":"66116649-1474-4532-9724-215e209703fe"},"execution_count":65,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/keras/src/layers/core/embedding.py:90: UserWarning: Argument `input_length` is deprecated.
